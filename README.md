# this is a code for a beginner webpage
# the motivation for this code was to try and put the skills that we have learn thus far to the tests and try and build a webpage "from scratch"
# the technology that I used was google, gitlab, github and VS code.
# although this project didn't necesarily solve any problems, I did learn that building websites are not as easy as one may thing. The smallest changes can affect your entire webpage and disrupt what you are trying to do.
